# A data distributor using Google Sheets.
a simple information query system that I made for my school, scrubbed of all information and released open source. It uses free Google services like sheets and apps script, but requires HTML hosting (e.g. google sites/github pages).

## Collection of Links
The Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFKHZYJk4w5KePJIDlo_4ULRcJYV65tfCiqSNmcZuuA/edit?usp=sharing   
Google Apps Script file: https://script.google.com/d/15wOJWA5am1g3yIwW-2hLszJqqphpm41lVk18u0LR8umvAy0o4oxKe7L9/edit?usp=sharing
  
  
## You may use these files in any way you like, just note that following default behaviours:  
1. Please change the links in the google apps script, and after deploying also edit the links in the HTML document   
2. Always ensure that the sheet you are using has "version 2.2" (or whatever text in the script that it is checked against in google apps script) **in cell A9**  
3. Regular Expressions in the HTML file _cannot_ be stored in a variable. I've tried, and wasted time troubleshooting it, so nope! Also, if you're changing or removing the RegEx, do remember to change it on the Apps Script side too!  
I'll add more when I can recall :D

 I hope this project is useful to you!
